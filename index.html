	I am an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa. You can just call me JK.<br>
	My major research interest is represenatation learning for conversational AI.<br>
	I received my PhD degree advised by <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~fosler-lussier.1/">Eric Fosler-Lussier</a> in the <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.osu.edu">The Ohio State University</a>.<br>
	During my PhD, I did three research internships on deep learning for conversational understanding at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/deepcu-deep-learning-conversational-understanding-2/">Microsoft</a> in summer 2016, deep & recursive neural networks for constituency parsing at <a href="http://www.nec-labs.com/research-departments/machine-learning/machine-learning-home">NEC Laboratories America</a> in summer 2015, and deep & recurrent neural networks for named entity recognition at <a href="http://nuance.com">Nuance</a> Sunnyvale in summer 2014.<br>
	Between 2012 and 2014, I worked on hierarchical compositions of acoustic features and different targets with deep neural networks for <a href="http://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/babel">IARPA's Babel Program</a>.<br>
	I received my MS degree advised by <a href="https://bi.snu.ac.kr/~btzhang/">Byoung-Tak Zhang</a> from <a href="http://www.useoul.edu/">Seoul National University</a> and my BE degree from <a href="http://www.sogang.ac.kr/english/">Sogang University</a>.<br>
	Before joining OSU, I worked at <a href="http://www.navercorp.com/en/index.nhn">NHN (Currently, Naver)</a> for two years as a software engineer developing Internet search services. Also before getting my bachelor's degree, as an industrial skilled personnel, I developed mobile games at ZIO Interactive and financial risk management software at <a href="http://www.ibksystem.co.kr/english/main.ibk">IBK System</a>.<br><br>
